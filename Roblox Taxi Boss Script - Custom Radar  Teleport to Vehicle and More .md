<h1>Roblox Taxi Boss Script - Custom Radar, Teleport to Vehicle and More</h1>

Taxi Boss, a widely popular Roblox game mode launched last year, has amassed over 39 million visits by challenging players to transport passengers, compete in races, and strive to dominate the leaderboards. Players earn in-game currency to upgrade their vehicles with customizations like spoilers, headlights, rims, and paint jobsâ€”or invest in entirely new cars for enhanced performance. While scripts for this mode remain scarce, one functional option has surfaced, offering features such as Customer Radar to locate fares, adjustable Walkspeed for faster navigation, and Teleport to Vehicle for quick returns to your car. This free script, accessible via the link below, provides a competitive edge for players eager to maximize their gameplay experience in this dynamic virtual world.
